# Websites created using Hugo

Just some websites I've created using https://github.com/spf13/hugo.

Each website has been containerised - the Docker images are hosted in Dockerhub. Credits to the Hugo Dockerfile from publysher/docker-hugo.
There is a docker-compose in each project to have a play around with them.

To use docker-compose for a local environment:

```
1. docker-compose up
2. Browse to localhost:1313
```

These websites will be updated to be run as part of a Kubernetes Platform.
